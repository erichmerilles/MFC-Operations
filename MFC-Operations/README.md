## Install in XAMPP

1. Extract this folder as `C:\xampp\htdocs\withdrawal-qb`.
2. Start Apache and MySQL.
3. Import `backend/database/schema.sql` in phpMyAdmin. It creates `withdrawal_qb` and example master records. Replace example clients/products/sites with the real company data before production.
4. Confirm database credentials in `backend/core/database.php` or set `WQ_DB_HOST`, `WQ_DB_NAME`, `WQ_DB_USER`, and `WQ_DB_PASS`.
5. If you install under a different folder, set `WQ_BASE_URL` to that URL prefix (for example `/my-folder`). Default is `/withdrawal-qb`.
6. Open `http://localhost/withdrawal-qb/frontend/setup.php` and create the first administrator account. Delete `frontend/setup.php` after initial setup.
7. Sign in at `http://localhost/withdrawal-qb/frontend/login.php`.

### Upgrade an existing database

Back up `withdrawal_qb` first. For an existing database, apply `20261015_invoice_number.sql` if it has not already been applied, then follow `backend/database/migrations/20261015_product_site_permissions.sql` in phpMyAdmin with `withdrawal_qb` selected. Apply `20261019_whole_number_quantities.sql` after reviewing its preflight behavior. It stops without changing quantity data if fractional historical quantities exist; reconcile those rows against authoritative records before rerunning. Apply `20261019_invoice_memo.sql` once to add the nullable invoice memo field. Do not import `schema.sql` over an existing database.

The product/site migration is intentionally staged:

1. Run the `ALTER`/`UPDATE` statements through creation of `employee_permissions`. Existing `item_code` and `description` are copied to the QB mapping fields; `product_name` is copied to the initial HT description because it is the existing withdrawal display text. The legacy columns and all product/site/transaction IDs remain intact.
2. Review the duplicate-code queries and the incomplete-mapping report. Resolve QB conflicts against the real item list. Supply each HT Code from the authoritative HT master list; the migration never manufactures one. Products without an HT Code cannot be selected for new withdrawals. Populate descriptions/mappings and set products active only when the required fields are confirmed.
3. Deploy the updated PHP files. Admins can complete legacy mappings in Products & Sites. Admins can grant Employee access in Settings using **Manage Products & Sites**.
4. After confirming the running code no longer reads `products.default_site_id`, inspect `SHOW CREATE TABLE products`, then manually run the commented FK and column drop statements at the end of the migration. Invoice line `site_id` is preserved. Only after reviewing/fixing duplicates, add the two commented unique indexes. Existing DB collation is case-insensitive in the supplied schema.

The migration file includes the review queries and commented final DDL. Keep a copy of the pre-migration backup until the new withdrawal, invoice and employee permission paths are verified in the local database.

## Phase 2 scope

- Local MySQL records for withdrawals and invoice preparation.
- Employee login, role checks, CSRF protection and activity log.
- Withdrawal create/edit/search/register and print view.
- Invoice draft separated from the source withdrawal; supports invoice-only additional lines.
- Product/site/client setup and CSV export.
- QuickBooks status view and queue schema.

## Important scope boundary

QuickBooks Web Connector connectivity is a **required Phase 2 acceptance item but is not yet implemented or verified in this package**. The remaining integration work must verify Web Connector authentication, authorization to the correct QuickBooks company file, qbXML request/response communication, a test invoice, successful and rejected responses, duplicate/uncertain-result handling, and documented customer/item mappings in the real QuickBooks Enterprise 24.0 environment. Do not enable invoice posting or claim success until these tests pass.

Invoice drafts retain local site, lot, item code, product identity/description, unit, price, amount, expiration, and local tax choice. These values are not proof of QuickBooks mappings. In particular, SITE, LOT NUMBER, ITEM CODE, U/M, EXPIRATION DATE, and the local `Non`/`Tax`/`Exempt` values need company-file field/configuration decisions and qbXML verification before posting. Customer and product `qb_list_id` values must also be populated from verified QuickBooks records. Posting remains disabled until a Web Connector service and explicit supported mappings are implemented.

## Print

Open a saved withdrawal and use **Print form**. The print page hides its own Print/Close controls and prints only the form content. The print template is an initial browser-print layout based on the known Excel fields; compare it with the Excel print preview and adjust page size/margins/column widths before production rollout.
